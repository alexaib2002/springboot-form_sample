# Sample SprinBoot Thymeleaf Form Project

Project made while doing a SpringBoot course with Thymeleaf forms. 

For making things more exciting, I've also used the Java Streams API in various parts of the project, 
thus giving it a more functional approach, as well as making it more null-safe.

Feel free to use it as a reference sheet for more advanced projects.
